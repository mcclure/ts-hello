This is a Typescript + Libp2p + Preact "Hello world" web app, intended for forking. Code is in `src/`, resources are in `static/` and when built it's installed in `site/`. Make sure to edit the package name, license and author in package.json when you fork it, and also edit license.txt unless you want to release in the public domain.

When run, the app connects to Libp2p and lists the peers it finds or any errors it encounters.

Created by Andi McClure based on the libp2p-in-the-browser demo from [js-libp2p](https://github.com/libp2p/js-libp2p).
